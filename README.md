Hello There,
Here, We are going to create a simple Currency Converter in Java that uses live rate using an API.

>I am using an API that is free from the website : https://www.exchangerate-api.com/

>I am using library that needs to be imported externally that needs to be put inside a lib folder.

>Use these commands to use the lib.
      > javac -cp ".;lib/json.jar" CurrencyConverter.java   
             --->lib/json.jar tells that there is lib folder that contains our library file i.e json.jar that need to be imported.It is also inside the same folder as CurrencyConverter.java
      > java -cp ".;lib/json.jar" CurrencyConverter
